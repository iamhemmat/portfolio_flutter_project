But what actually made me interested in it? The first event I participated in, which was “Flutter Interact Codelab”. Actually, I had not known a lot about DSC and had not been sure enough if its events were worthwhile to participate in when I applied, but the event changed everything. 26th December 2021 was the day on which I was informed about the flutter event. I was excited to participate since I had been passionate about building applications for Android and iOS platforms. Also, I felt it is an opportunity to take a step toward my goals, therefore I applied. I was confident to be one of the accepted applicants. Nevertheless, I did not receive the approval e-mail till close days to the program. So I had been getting discouraged when I saw the e-mail, but after being accepted, I was so happy. It is one of the interesting memories I have had in university. The event was great and useful and helped me to be more productive. ";
